# Configure your client with the backend

If you would like to use an alternative backend server (The server responsible for saving user data across devices) then you can specify your own URL **without needing to host your own movie-web frontend!**

Changing your backend server will log you out of your account - make sure you have a copy of your 12-word passphrase saved safely in case you need to go back!

1. On movie-web, got to your settings page by click the menu icon at the top right and then `Settings`.
1. Scroll down the page to the section named `Connections` where there is a toggle named `Custom server`. 
1. Enable the `Custom server` toggle and enter your backend URL in the input box named `Custom server URL`.
1. Click `Save` at the bottom right corner of your screen.
