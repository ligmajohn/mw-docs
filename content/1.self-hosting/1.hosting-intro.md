There are a few configurations of hosting movie-web. Each with their own benefits.
**If you don't know what to choose, go with method 1.**

## Method 1 - Only host the frontend
With this method, you only host the essential parts that make movie-web work. But keep using the account server from offical movie-web.
This method is the easiest to self-host and is recommended for most users.

1. [Setup the Proxy!](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md)
2. [Setup the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)

## Method 2 - Only host the account server
If you want to own your own data, it's possible to selfhost just the account server and nothing else.
This method is only recommended if you have experience hosting databases or other similar stateful applications.

1. [Setup the Backend!](../4.backend/1.deploy.md)
2. [Configure the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)

## Method 3 - Host everything
If you want an instance that's completely isolated from official movie-web. You can selfhost all parts.
This method is not recommended for inexperienced hosters.

1. [Setup the Proxy!](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md)
2. [Setup the Backend!](../4.backend/1.deploy.md)
3. [Setup the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)
