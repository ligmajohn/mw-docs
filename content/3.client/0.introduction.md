# Introduction to the client

The client is what the main part of the application, it houses the interface and all of the scraping logic.

## PWA

The client can be optionally ran as a PWA. This can be hard to do correctly and really hard to reverse, so it's generally not recommended to do so if you don't have experience hosting PWA's.

You can read more about it [here](../1.self-hosting/3.about-pwa.md).

## Configuration

The client has a decent amount of configuration options. You can view them all [here](./3.configuration.md).
