# Instances

This page showcases movie-web instances hosted by the community and other alternative sites. If you want to add your instance to this list, please open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/movie-web/docs).

## Community Backend

Our partner, Lonelil, has kindly offered to host a movie-web backend with a copy of the original data from the movie-web.app. You can access this backend at: `https://mw-backend.lonelil.com`

You **do not** have to set up a new account; you can use your previous passphrase from movie-web, and all of your data will be there!

## Community Instances

The community maintains these trusted instances, meaning they are likely to be up-to-date. Remember that since these are volunteer instances, they might be down or stop working at any time. If you want to be sure you have access to movie-web, consider [hosting your own instance](../1.self-hosting/1.hosting-intro.md). 

**Instances marked with a 💾 have set up a backend, making it possible to sync your data across multiple devices.**<br />
**Additionally, instances with a 🌐 use the community backend hosted by Lonelil, which has all the original movie-web.app data!**
