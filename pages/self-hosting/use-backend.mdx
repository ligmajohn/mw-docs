# Configure your client with the backend

If you would like to use an alternative backend server (the server responsible for saving user data across devices) then you can specify your own URL **without needing to host your own movie-web frontend!**

<Caution>
Changing your backend server will log you out of your account - make sure you have a copy of your 12-word passphrase saved in case you need to go back!
</Caution>

1. On movie-web, click the menu icon at the top right and then `Settings`.
1. Scroll down the page to the `Connections` section.
1. Enable the `Custom server` toggle and enter your backend URL in the input box that appears.
1. Click `Save` at the bottom right corner of your screen.
