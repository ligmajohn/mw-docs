# Deploying the proxy

## Method 1 - Netlify (Easy)

Netlify has a very generous free plan, so you'll be able to host your proxy for free unless you get hundreds of users.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/movie-web/simple-proxy)

1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup if you don't have one already.
1. Click on the `Deploy to Netlify` button above.
   1. Authorize Netlify to connect with GitHub by clicking the `Connect to GitHub` button.
1. There should now be a `Save & Deploy` button, click it.
1. Once the deployment is complete, click on the `Get Started` button that pops up, this will redirect you to the dashboard of your site.
1. Click on the only site in the `Sites` section of your dashboard.
1. Find the link of your site near the top of the page, it should look something like `https://<random-words>.netlify.app`. Right click the link, click `Copy link address`. [Now you'll just have to set up the client](../extra/streaming.md#method-1---self-hosted-proxy)!

## Method 2 - Cloudflare (Easy)

<Warning>
The sources showbox and febbox do NOT work with cloudflare. Use a different host if you want those to work.
</Warning>

Cloudflare has a generous free plan, so you don't need to pay anything unless you get hundreds of users.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/movie-web/simple-proxy)

## Method 4 - Docker

<Warning>
Experience with Docker, domains and web hosting is **highly recommended** for this method. <br />
[Deploying with Netlify](#method-1-netlify-easy) is easier and safer to do! You are exposing your server at your own risk!
</Warning>

Our `simple-proxy` application is available from the GitHub Container Registry under the image [`ghcr.io/movie-web/simple-proxy:latest`](https://ghcr.io/movie-web/simple-proxy:latest)

The container exposes the HTTP port (Without TLS/SSL) as `3000/TCP`.

If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.
