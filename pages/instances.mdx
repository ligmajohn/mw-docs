# Instances

This page showcases movie-web instances hosted by the community and other alternative sites. If you want to add your instance to this list, please open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/movie-web/docs).

## Community Instances

The community maintains these trusted instances, meaning they are likely to be up-to-date. Remember that since these are volunteer instances, they might be down or stop working at any time. If you want to be sure you have access to movie-web, consider [hosting your own instance](../1.self-hosting/1.hosting-intro.md).

**Instances marked with a 💾 have set up a backend, making it possible to sync your data across multiple devices.**

**Additionally, instances with a 🌐 use the community backend hosted by Lonelil, which has all the original movie-web.app data!**

**Moreover, instances marked with a 📱 have full PWA compatibility, enabling usage on your mobile device as if it were a native application.**

## Community Backend

Our partner, Lonelil, has kindly offered to host a movie-web backend with a copy of the original data from the movie-web.app. You can access this backend at: `https://mw-backend.lonelil.com` or `https://mw-backend.lonelil.ru`

You **do not** have to set up a new account; you can use your previous passphrase from movie-web, and all of your data will be there!

## Alternatives

These sites are not related to movie-web but are good enough to switch to if the official instances are down. You can also use [FMHY](https://fmhy.pages.dev/videopiracyguide) to find even more options.
